This is a achieved by them by <strong>Crystal growth technique</strong> which grows ferroelectric memristor on a CMOS circuit through a seed layer. Here in the atoms in the interlayer insulator film have an unordered arrangement. When a ferroelectric memristor is formed directly on the circuit, the arrangement of the atoms in the ferroelectric film also becomes distorted. Panasonic was successful in designing a ferroelectric memristor with a highly oriented crystal lattice by utilizing a seed layer, which is well ordered.

Such chips which imitate human behavior were first known to be possible way back in 1988 through a research work on silicon retina by Caver Mead and Kritof Koch. However, there seems to be a long way to go for such chips. The use of memristor has not only sparked newer interest in these neuromorphic designs but with this work, the future seems much closer.
