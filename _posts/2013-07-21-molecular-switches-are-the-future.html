IBM scientist <strong>Emanuel Loertscher </strong>who is actively working on molecular electronics shares his insights on molecular switches in an article "<em>Wiring molecules into circuits</em>". Here he discuss real challenges that the industry is facing to sustain Moore's law. In an interview on IBMResearch blog page, he has the following to say :

<i>One of the largest areas of focus for IBM in this field is designing what we call "the next switch".  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moore%27s_law" target="_blank">Moore's Law</a> is going to hit a wall shortly as we can no longer reduce the size of transistors every 18 months. Therefore we are currently investigating the role of molecular electronics to potentially offer novel device concepts, which are ultimately scaled and provide electronic functionalities beyond the transistor one’s. </i>

<i>More specifically, we are studying functional molecules where electrical resistance can be switched when the molecule is contacted by two electrodes (in a so-called two-terminal geometry). In contrast to many other devices where a third electrode is needed, the two-terminal concept enables ultimate scaling and therefore highest integration densities for memory applications. </i>

<i>We are also trying to work towards more realistic devices where the molecules are embedded and sealed in small pores and contacted in cross-bar structures. Just recently I’ve started a complementary activity using nano-optical means in plasmonic structures to study the assembly and vibrational properties of molecules inside the junction with the goal to correlate optical and electrical experiments.</i>
