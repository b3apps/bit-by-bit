A Spanish <a href="http://www.electronicosonline.com/">magazine</a> has recently published an article covering our research on memristor.  You can read the original version in Spanish <a href="http://www.electronicosonline.com/2013/07/25/revelan-secretos-de-los-memristores/">here</a>. However, we have translated the aricle in English below.  Please note, this is the magazine's interpretation of our work.

We would like to thank Ms. Sabina Preda for helping us with Spanish to English translation of this article.

<em>Memory Resistors or Memristors, an industrial application which dates back several decades, have now been proven to be a more common element than we have imagined.</em>

<em>(ElectronicosOnline.com Magazine / Oswaldo Barajas)</em>

<em>In 1971, the scientist Leon Chua, professor at the University of Berkeley California, postulated the memristor for the industry, after research that ultimately gave him the nickname of the "Theoretical father of memristors". For many years his theory has been discussed, until in 2008, and currently in 2012, when non-believers began to take seriously the probable fact of Chua’s scientific claims: "memristors do exist".</em>

<em>The memristors are essentially memory resistors, and due to their profile, have been considered as the fourth passive electrical element after the key inductors, capacitors and resistors.</em>

<em>Memristor would presumably function as a data storage memory because the level of their electrical resistance changes when current is applied. While a typical resistor provides a stable level of resistance, a memristor can have a high level of resistance that can be interpreted in binary code. Thus, by controlling the current, data can be saved and rewritten, increasing its flexibility to the extent that, Chua and other researchers who have joined in this theory after seeing the reality of their existence, have gone ahead to claim that these devices can permit the design of computers that can emulate/imitate the human brain, or even increases to up to 100 the storage capacity of conventional electronic memories.</em>

<em>Forty-two years have elapsed since Chua postulated the memristor for the industry, but it is only now that other researchers have joined this line of research. Such is the case of the two engineers from mLabs of India, Gaurav Gandhi and Varun Aggarwal, who submitted the scientific articles: "Switching Bipolar Power Metal-Metal Contacts" and "The First Radios Were Made Using Memristors", and following this route, have been awarded the discovery of the simplest physical implementation for memristors.</em>

<em>The paper that publicized this news, the official magazine of the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE) Spectrum, stated that, thanks to the technical trials of Chua, colleagues Gandhi and Aggarwal succeeded in identifying the true origin of these devices, and commented that a simple imperfect point contacts all around and acts as a memristor.</em>

<em>"Our document 'arXiv' talks about the logic that compares an imperfect metal-metal contact  materialized in points of contact between two metal balls, medium granular or metal-mercury interface," said Gandhi. "Furthermore, the CAS document compares imperfect contact of metal-semiconductor which was also the first solid state diode. Both systems have in common an imperfect contact point between two partially conductive elements and both act like memristors, "added Gaurav Gandhi.</em>

<em>In this way, a memristor acts as a flash memory to retain data longer than other memories, and unlike the conventional nonvolatile devices, memristors consume a much smaller amount of energy and require very little material to manufacture.</em>

<em>"Resistance always offers the same level of difficulty to the passage of the current, while the memristor does not, because it varies depending on the amount of electricity and the direction of the flow: in one direction, the resistance increases, in the other, it decreases" says Leon Chua. "The memristor can remember the last voltage it was subjected to, in such a way that the data may be interpreted as 0 and 1, but also in entire gradation states. In other words, by controlling the electric current flowing through this component, the desired information can be written or erased. "</em>

<em><b>Great Future for Memristors</b></em>

<em>The memristors await a great future in the electronics of tomorrow, not only in the mind of Chua – the  precursor of this technology – but for other researchers, and even high-tech companies, that predict excellent times for memories-resistance and a large profitable niche in the short and medium term.</em>

<em>One of the companies that have been working on these devices is Hewlett-Packard, which opened scientific departments in 2008 and is now the company that is able to materialize these components. It is estimated that the first HP memristors will be launched in 2014.</em>

<em>From the outset, memristors are considered a good substitute for RAM memories, for memristor-based memory would allow, for example, the turning off of the computer without saving the changes of graphic design projects and turning it on days later, and finding it exactly as before.</em>

<em>For more robust software platforms, such as biometric systems, memristor technology would provide resources to electronic engineers in designing computers capable of storing and even intelligently associating body patterns as humans would, through experience and comparisons.</em>

<em>It is noteworthy that many of the processes that require implementation of fuzzy logic, such as biometric systems, have a complex stage of development, which is to solve the pattern recognition by yes-no or digits 1-0, but with memristor technology this procedure would be more efficient.</em>
