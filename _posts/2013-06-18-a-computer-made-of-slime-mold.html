Have you thought that the chips of future may use biology rather than silicon ?

In a recent work featured at <a href="http://www.newscientist.com">New Scientist</a> researchers have shown that slime mold, A garish yellow slime that grows on rotten leaves and logs, is infact memristive in Nature.

Slime mold and their memory property has always fascinated scientist . What is not known is that they behave like a memristor.

Two years ago, while I was a visiting faculty at Biotech division at NSIT, I gave an exciting task to students. One of the project was to study the memory behavior of slime mold and map the same to Delhi Metro to analyze the efficiency of Delhi metro. The project was loosely based on <a href="http://www.wired.com/wiredscience/2010/01/slime-mold-grows-network-just-like-tokyo-rail-system/">Slime Mold Grows Network Just Like Tokyo Rail System</a>.

The target was two fold a) to study the memory behavior of slime mold ; b) to suggest students that their education can have applications even in fields like urban planning etc. Though the research ended inconclusively, it gave us food for thought. Now observing the memristive behavior in slime mold, I am sure will encourage students to re-look at the problem with newer approach.

What better, Ella Gale, the lead author of the research, says ""Slime mould can be used to perform all the logic functions that conventional computer hardware components can do," Biotech can have applications beyond traditional solutions will motivate students to cross boundaries and explore unconventional territories, a feat required for innovation.
