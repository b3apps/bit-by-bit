<em><strong>Find the creative hardware designer in you</strong></em>

Fun, educational, unique and revolutionary. Bit By Bit helps you explore the world of hardware designing Bit By Bit - Raspberry Pi based and has a dedicated fun-store. [embedyt] http://youtu.be/iqwiBEIh8VQ [/embedyt]

<strong>What is it?</strong> <a href="http://mlabsresearch.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/IM1.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-137" src="http://mlabsresearch.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/IM1.jpg" alt="IM1" width="601" height="547" /></a>

A revolutionary product of the size of a mini-tablet which helps you become a maker instantly. You can design your own phone or a music player, a time-lapse camera or a drone all with a click of a button! We call it Bit by Bit aka B3. Make your own Do-It-Yourself gadgets, learn programming, design circuits and build your own internet of things, instantly. You can build different products using B3 by going to our Fun Store, a collaborative cloud-based environment and choose/modify/create apps using a simple GUI. <em>What is more:</em> Share the apps you design with hackers around the world!

<strong>How does it work?</strong>

Fun Store, our application store for various hardware, enables single click hardware design. Just think of a possibility which uses your physical world, place the required components on the B3, login to Fun Store and click 'Start this app' and you are good to go. If you want to configure or re-program the design, a visual programming guide is provided which not only teaches you how to program, but also helps you design new functionalities which can be shared with others to use. <a style="color: #999999;" href="http://mlabsresearch.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/IM41.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-156" src="http://mlabsresearch.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/IM41.jpg" alt="IM4" width="629" height="406" /></a>

Fun Store has more than 1000 applications to design and program circuits ranging from basic tutorials to useful day-to-day appliances. Bit by Bit is aimed at holding your hand and taking you through an entire course of designing easily, efficiently and in an interactive way. You need not be an engineer, our product does everything for you. From teaching concepts to developing applications to making circuits, it is a kit to design hardware collaboratively.   <a href="http://mlabsresearch.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/RaspberryPi.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-180" src="http://mlabsresearch.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/RaspberryPi.jpg" alt="RaspberryPi" width="598" height="427" /></a>

<strong>Raspberry Pi</strong>

BitByBit has Raspberry Pi  as the foundation. So if you have designed some real cool gadget or a new hack based around Raspberry Pi and want to share with the world, this is your platform. You can redesign everything almost instantly and share with the rest of the community as easy as sending an email. It is also powered with social plugins to let you share your creativity with the rest of the world via your favorite social media platform (Facebook/Twitter.) <a href="http://mlabsresearch.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/Funstore.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-182" src="http://mlabsresearch.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/Funstore.jpg" alt="Funstore" width="2281" height="1328" /></a><strong>Fun Store empowers you to design circuits without wires </strong> Traditionally designing circuits required wires, function generators, voltmeters, expensive oscilloscopes and a lot of time. With B3, you do not need any of these (or wires!). You can now conﬁgure connections of the breadboard on your smartphone! Also, you can convert your phone to an oscilloscope, generate required functions in no time. You can save any app in Fun Store for others to redesign or collaborate, all by a click of a button. (<em>This feature requires additional B3 cover module containing ADC/DAC</em>) <a style="color: #999999;" href="http://mlabsresearch.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/IM7.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-143" src="http://mlabsresearch.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/IM7.jpg" alt="IM7" width="629" height="376" /></a>   <a href="http://mlabsresearch.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/who_is_it.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-198" src="http://mlabsresearch.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/who_is_it.jpg" alt="who_is_it" width="582" height="376" /></a> <strong><a style="color: #999999;" href="http://mlabsresearch.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/IM6.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-142" src="http://mlabsresearch.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/IM6.jpg" alt="IM6" width="629" height="487" /></a></strong>

<strong>Why did we design Bit by Bit?</strong>

Best gadgets are not the ones which are technologically advanced but are the ones which takes technology out of its way and enable everyone to use the technology. B3 is created with same long term vision. Back in the day, installing and configuring software required specific knowledge too complex for people with non-technical backgrounds. Smartphones (iPhone to be specific) and the app store was a game changer as it introduced single click install to everyone. We believe the world of hardware design is at the same stage as early software development. You still need to search for hardware, wire/solder it, program it and then properly package it. In short, it is still too complicated! With B3 we will change that. We want to make it simple by taking technology out of way. Also, just like software, we want to enable people to collaborate across geographies and develop hardware with a single click. You can explore our approach here:

<strong>Who are we?</strong> <a href="http://mlabsresearch.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/B3_Illustration.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-195" src="http://mlabsresearch.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/B3_Illustration.jpg" alt="B3_Illustration" width="5000" height="3000" /></a> Special thanks to: Many employees, interns, advisors and friends who helped us shape the product bit by bit. From backend coding to choosing the font, positioning to pricing, they all helped us shape it somehow at some stage. Most of you chose to stay anonymous while others are (in no specific order)

<strong>Pricing</strong>

*All perks come with 6 month access to App-store. You can download the code for any app that you have designed (plus ones provided by us) for offline usage as well. **We will try to keep the app-store free as long as possible for the entire community. Like you, we also want to change the world, Bit by Bit. ***Most of these apps will require additional electronic components other than the ones available in the kit. All of these components are available from nearby radio-shack. <a href="http://mlabsresearch.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/IM11.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-147" src="http://mlabsresearch.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/IM11.jpg" alt="IM11" width="629" height="597" /></a>   <strong>Technical Specifications</strong> • Built on Raspberry Pi (Rev B) [Given with B3 199$] • USB charger, Wifi-Adapter [Given with B3 199$] • 32 GND pins, 16 +3.3Vpins, 16 +5V pins • 160 Breadboard Analog/Digital I/O pins • 14 Digital I/O pins • B-Covers Compatible • ADC and DAC compatible • Arduino compatible • Communication via Serial UART Bus-System, each module can communicate to any other module in a bidirectional way • Bluetooth 4.0 (BLE) module for app control and firmware update • Speaker for sound feedback • Reset Buttons • Customized Raspbian for Raspberry Pi • Online Oscilloscope Access • 6-month free access to App-store
